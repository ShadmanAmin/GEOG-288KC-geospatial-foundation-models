## **GEOG 288KC: Geospatial Foundation Models and Applications**

**Fall 2025**  
**Fridays 9am-12pm \+ optional lab office hours Fridays 2pm-5pm**

---

### **Course Overview**

This course introduces students to state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Through a mix of lecture, discussion, and hands-on labs, students will explore frontier techniques in geospatial AI—including self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders, multimodal sensor fusion, and scalable inference pipelines—while developing their own applied project.

---

### **Prerequisites**

* Students should have some experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, or ML (e.g., Python, Earth Engine, PyTorch). 

* Because this is a project-driven seminar, students should have a topic area in which they are interested in applying GeoFMs. 

---

### **Applications**

To apply, students should submit a paragraph at the [form link](https://forms.gle/Q1iDp2kuZuX1avMPA) below describing their past experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, and ML, as well as their interest in Geospatial Foundation Models. They should also describe their application of interest. The more clearly defined the potential project goal and any existing fine-tuning data the better, though students will also have the opportunity to refine their ideas throughout the course as we learn more about GeoFMs and what they are capable of.
