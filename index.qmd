## Course Description

This project-driven seminar introduces students to state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Through a mix of lecture, discussion, and hands-on labs, students will explore frontier techniques in geospatial AI—including self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders, multimodal sensor fusion, and scalable inference pipelines—while developing their own applied project.

The goal of GEOG 288KC (Geospatial Foundation Models and Applications) is to equip students with cutting-edge skills in applying foundation models to environmental challenges. By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Understand and apply state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models for environmental monitoring

- Fine-tune and adapt large-scale models for specific remote sensing applications

- Build scalable processing pipelines using Earth Engine, TorchGeo, and cloud computing platforms

- Create interactive applications and APIs for model deployment and visualization

- Evaluate and interpret foundation model outputs using robust validation frameworks

- Collaborate on applied research projects and communicate results to diverse audiences

## Getting Started with the UCSB AI Sandbox

[Here](installation/UCSB_AI_SANDBOX_SETUP.md) are detailed instructions for setting up your environment on the UCSB AI Sandbox, including foundation model installation and GPU optimization.
