## Course Description

This project-driven seminar teaches students to build geospatial foundation models (GFMs) from scratch. Students implement every layer of the pipeline‚Äîfrom data pipelines and tokenization through attention mechanisms, full architectures, pretraining, evaluation, and deployment‚Äîculminating in a working end-to-end GFM tailored to a chosen geospatial application.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement geospatial data pipelines for multi-spectral, spatial, and temporal data
- Build attention mechanisms and assemble transformer-based architectures for geospatial inputs
- Pretrain using masked autoencoding and evaluate learned representations
- Fine-tune models for specific Earth observation tasks
- Deploy models via APIs and interactive interfaces with honest performance analysis

## Getting Started with the UCSB AI Sandbox

[Here](installation/UCSB_AI_SANDBOX_SETUP.md) are detailed instructions for setting up your environment on the UCSB AI Sandbox, including foundation model installation and GPU optimization.

## Course Structure: 3 Stages, 9 Steps

### üèóÔ∏è Stage 1: Build GFM Architecture (Weeks 1-3)
- Week 1: Geospatial Data Foundations (data pipelines, tokenization, loaders)
- Week 2: Spatial-Temporal Attention Mechanisms (from-scratch implementation)
- Week 3: Complete GFM Architecture (Vision Transformer for geospatial)

### üöÄ Stage 2: Train a Foundation Model (Weeks 4-7)
- Week 4: Pretraining Implementation (masked autoencoder)
- Week 5: Training Loop Optimization (stability, efficiency, mixed precision)
- Week 6: Model Evaluation & Analysis (embeddings, probing, reconstructions)
- Week 7: Integration with Existing Models (Prithvi, SatMAE)

### üéØ Stage 3: Apply & Deploy (Weeks 8-10)
- Week 8: Task-Specific Fine-tuning (efficient strategies, few-shot)
- Week 9: Model Implementation & Deployment (APIs, UI, benchmarking)
- Week 10: Project Presentations & Synthesis
