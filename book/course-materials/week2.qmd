## Week 2 Overview

This week implements attention mechanisms from scratch, adapting them specifically for spatial-temporal geospatial relationships.

### Learning Objectives
- Implement self-attention from scratch
- Adapt attention for spatial relationships
- Add temporal attention for time series
- Understand positional encoding for 2D/3D data

### Key Topics
- **Multi-head Self-Attention**: Implementation from mathematical formulations
- **2D Positional Encoding**: Spatial position encoding for image patches
- **Temporal Encoding**: Time series attention for satellite sequences
- **Cross-attention**: Multi-modal data fusion mechanisms
- **Attention Visualization**: Understanding learned attention patterns

### Activities
- [ ] Implement multi-head attention from scratch
- [ ] Build 2D positional encoding for spatial patches
- [ ] Create temporal attention for time series data
- [ ] Visualize and interpret attention patterns

### Technical Skills
- Mathematical implementation of attention mechanisms
- PyTorch tensor operations and gradient computation
- Attention pattern visualization
- Debugging dimension mismatches and training issues

### Interactive Session
[Session 2: Spatial-Temporal Attention Mechanisms](weekly-sessions/session2_attention_mechanisms.qmd) - Live coding session: Building attention mechanisms with intentional errors and debugging

### **Week 2 Deliverable**
Custom attention module for geospatial data with spatial and temporal components

### Resources
- Attention mechanism mathematical foundations
- Transformer architecture deep dive
- Spatial attention for computer vision

### Next Week Preview
Week 3 will assemble the complete GFM architecture using our custom attention modules.
