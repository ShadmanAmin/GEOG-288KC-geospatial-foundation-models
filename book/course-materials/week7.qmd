## Week 7 Overview



This week integrates with existing foundation models and compares custom implementations against state-of-the-art.

### Learning Objectives
- Load and use pretrained foundation models
- Compare custom vs. state-of-the-art models
- Understand when to build vs. use existing models
- Implement model ensembling

### Key Topics
- **Loading Prithvi and SatMAE**: Working with pretrained weights
- **Architecture Compatibility**: Adapting existing models to new data
- **Performance Comparison**: Custom models vs. state-of-the-art
- **Transfer Learning**: Strategies for model adaptation
- **Model Selection**: Criteria for choosing when to build vs. use

### Activities
- [ ] Load and configure Prithvi and SatMAE models
- [ ] Adapt architectures for compatibility with course data
- [ ] Compare performance against custom models
- [ ] Implement transfer learning strategies
- [ ] Create model selection framework

### Interactive Session
[Session 7: Integration with Existing Models](interactive-sessions/session7_pretrained_integration.qmd) - Working with Prithvi, SatMAE, and performance comparison

### Development Focus
- Independent implementation with instructor feedback
- Small-group collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Troubleshooting sessions and milestone tracking

### **Week 7 Deliverable**
Integrated system using multiple models with performance comparison and model selection guidelines

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Development Best Practices**: Code organization, testing frameworks, documentation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Computational efficiency, resource utilization, bottleneck identification
- **Version Control**: Branching strategies, collaborative workflows, milestone tracking
- **Environment Management**: Reproducible setups, dependency management, deployment preparation

### Peer Collaboration Framework
