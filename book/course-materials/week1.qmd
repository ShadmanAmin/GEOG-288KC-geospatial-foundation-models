## Week 1 Overview

This week establishes the foundation for building geospatial foundation models by mastering data preparation and preprocessing pipelines.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand geospatial data as foundation model input
- Implement robust data preprocessing pipelines
- Handle missing data (clouds, gaps) effectively
- Create temporal sequences from satellite imagery

### Key Topics
- **Geospatial Tokenization**: Convert satellite imagery to model-ready tokens
- **Multi-spectral Data**: Properties and preprocessing of different bands
- **Cloud Masking**: Strategies for handling missing data
- **Temporal Sequences**: Building time series from satellite imagery
- **Data Loaders**: Efficient batch processing for training

### Activities
- [ ] Build complete geospatial tokenization pipeline
- [ ] Implement cloud masking and missing data strategies
- [ ] Create temporal sequence datasets
- [ ] Optimize data loading for large-scale training

### Resources
- Multi-spectral satellite data properties
- Cloud masking algorithms and implementations
- PyTorch data loading best practices

### Interactive Session
[Session 1: Geospatial Data Foundations](weekly-sessions/session1_data_foundations.qmd) - Hands-on implementation of geospatial data preprocessing pipeline

### **Week 1 Deliverable**
Complete geospatial data pipeline capable of processing satellite imagery for foundation model training

### Next Week Preview
Week 2 will implement spatial-temporal attention mechanisms from scratch.
