## Week 6 Overview



This week evaluates representation quality, assesses reconstruction performance, and compares against baselines.

### Learning Objectives
- Evaluate representation quality
- Assess reconstruction performance
- Compare against baselines
- Understand learned features

### Key Topics
- **Embedding Visualization**: t-SNE, UMAP for learned representations
- **Reconstruction Quality**: Assessment metrics and visual analysis
- **Linear Probing**: Evaluation of learned features for downstream tasks
- **Feature Interpretation**: Understanding what the model has learned
- **Ablation Studies**: Component importance analysis

### Activities
- [ ] Generate and visualize learned embeddings
- [ ] Evaluate reconstruction quality on test data
- [ ] Implement linear probing for classification tasks
- [ ] Analyze learned attention patterns and features
- [ ] Compare against random initialization baselines

### Interactive Session
[Session 6: Model Evaluation & Analysis](interactive-sessions/session6_evaluation.qmd) - Comprehensive evaluation with embedding visualization and performance analysis

### **Week 6 Deliverable**
