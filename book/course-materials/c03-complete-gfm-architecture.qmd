| Week | Stage | Focus | You will build (geogfm) | Library tools | Outcome |
|------|-------|-------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|
| 3 | Stage 1: Build GFM Architecture | Complete Architecture | `models/gfm_vit.py`; `modules/heads/reconstruction_head.py` | `torch.nn` (timm as reference) | Encoder assembled; end-to-end forward on dummy input |

### Weekly goals
- Wire blocks into a GeoViT-style encoder
- Add a simple reconstruction head
