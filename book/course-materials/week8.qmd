## Week 8 Overview



This week adapts foundation models for specific tasks using efficient fine-tuning strategies.

### Learning Objectives
- Adapt foundation models for specific tasks
- Implement efficient fine-tuning strategies
- Handle limited labeled data
- Evaluate task performance

### Key Topics
- **Full Fine-tuning vs. Parameter-efficient**: LoRA and adapter strategies
- **Few-shot Learning**: Working with limited labeled data
- **Task-specific Data**: Preparation and augmentation strategies
- **Multi-task Learning**: Joint training for multiple objectives
