## Week 4 Overview



This week implements masked autoencoder pretraining for geospatial foundation models, setting up the complete training pipeline.

### Learning Objectives
- Implement masked autoencoder objective
- Set up distributed training pipeline
- Monitor training progress effectively
- Handle large-scale geospatial datasets

### Key Topics
- **Masked Patch Reconstruction**: Prithvi-style self-supervised learning
- **Training Data Preparation**: Augmentation and batch creation
- **Loss Functions**: Reconstruction loss for masked patches
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU setup and synchronization
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Training metrics and visualization

### Activities
