## Course Description

This project-driven seminar teaches students to build geospatial foundation models (GFMs) from scratch. Students implement every layer of the pipeline—from data pipelines and tokenization through attention mechanisms, full architectures, pretraining, evaluation, and deployment—culminating in a working end-to-end GFM tailored to a chosen geospatial application.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement geospatial data pipelines for multi-spectral, spatial, and temporal data
- Build attention mechanisms and assemble transformer-based architectures for geospatial inputs
- Pretrain using masked autoencoding and evaluate learned representations
- Fine-tune models for specific Earth observation tasks
- Deploy models via APIs and interactive interfaces with honest performance analysis

## Getting Started with the UCSB AI Sandbox

[Here](../installation/UCSB_AI_SANDBOX_SETUP.md) are detailed instructions for setting up your environment on the UCSB AI Sandbox, including foundation model installation and GPU optimization.
