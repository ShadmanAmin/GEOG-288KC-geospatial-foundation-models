## **GEOG 288KC: Building Geospatial Foundation Models**

**Fall 2025**  
**Fridays 9am-12pm \+ optional lab office hours Fridays 2pm-5pm**

---

### **Course Overview**

This course teaches students to build geospatial foundation models (GFMs) from scratch for remote sensing and environmental monitoring. Following the framework from "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka, students will implement every component of the foundation model pipeline‚Äîfrom data geospatial embedding and attention mechanisms to training loops and  deployment‚Äîwhile developing their own working foundation model. We will also download and use frontier GFMs such as Prithvi.

### **Prerequisites**

* Students should have some experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, or ML (e.g., Python, Earth Engine, PyTorch). 

* Because this is a project-driven seminar, students should have a topic area in which they are interested in applying GeoFMs. 

---

### **Applications**

To apply, students should submit a paragraph at the [form link](https://forms.gle/Q1iDp2kuZuX1avMPA) below describing their past experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, and ML, as well as their interest in building (not just using) Geospatial Foundation Models. They should describe a specific geospatial problem they want to solve by building a custom foundation model. The more clearly defined the target application and any existing datasets the better, though students will refine their approach as they learn to build complete GFM pipelines.
