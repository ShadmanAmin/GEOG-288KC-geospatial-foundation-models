## Week 7 Overview

Intensive development week focused on implementing core project functionality with structured technical workshops, peer collaboration, and regular progress check-ins.

### Learning Objectives
- Implement core model training, fine-tuning, or inference workflows
- Establish robust evaluation and validation methodologies
- Build scalable data processing and analysis pipelines
- Create preliminary results and validate technical approaches

### Development Focus Areas
- **Model Implementation**: Training loops, fine-tuning strategies, inference optimization
- **Data Workflows**: Efficient processing, feature engineering, quality validation
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Metrics implementation, validation strategies, result analysis
- **System Integration**: Component interaction, error handling, performance monitoring

### Activities
- [ ] Implement core model functionality (training/fine-tuning/inference)
- [ ] Complete data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Establish evaluation methodology and initial validation results
- [ ] Create visualization and result analysis workflows
- [ ] Conduct technical code review and optimization

### Workshop Sessions
**Technical Workshops (9am-10:30am)**:
- **Monday/Wednesday**: Advanced debugging and optimization strategies
- **Tuesday/Thursday**: Model evaluation and validation techniques
- All sessions include peer code reviews and collaborative problem-solving

**Development Time (10:30am-12pm)**:
