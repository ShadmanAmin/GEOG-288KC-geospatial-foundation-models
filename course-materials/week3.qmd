## Week 3 Overview

This week covers techniques for fine-tuning geospatial foundation models for specific applications, along with developing concrete project proposals.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand different fine-tuning strategies for foundation models
- Learn parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, adapters)
- Develop skills in transfer learning for geospatial applications
- Formulate detailed project proposals with clear objectives

### Key Topics
- **Fine-tuning Strategies**: Full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient methods
- **Transfer Learning**: Domain adaptation, few-shot learning, zero-shot capabilities
- **Model Architecture Modifications**: Adding task-specific heads, multi-task learning
- **Training Considerations**: Data requirements, computational resources, evaluation metrics

### Activities
- [ ] Hands-on fine-tuning workshop with sample datasets
- [ ] Project ideation sessions and feasibility discussions
