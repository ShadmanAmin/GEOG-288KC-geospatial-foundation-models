## Week 2 Overview

This week focuses on the practical aspects of working with geospatial data and understanding outputs from pre-trained foundation models.

### Learning Objectives
- Master geospatial data formats and preprocessing pipelines
- Understand foundation model input requirements and output interpretations
- Learn to work with multi-spectral and multi-temporal data
- Develop skills in data visualization and analysis workflows

### Key Topics
- **Data Formats**: GeoTIFF, NetCDF, Zarr, Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Normalization, tiling, temporal alignment, cloud masking
- **Model I/O**: Input preparation, batch processing, output post-processing
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps, time series plots, embedding spaces

### Activities
- [ ] Hands-on data preprocessing workshop
- [ ] Working with satellite imagery from different sensors (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS)
- [ ] Extracting and visualizing embeddings from pre-trained models
- [ ] Building data loading pipelines with TorchGeo

### Technical Skills
- GDAL and rasterio for geospatial data handling
- xarray for multi-dimensional data analysis
- TorchGeo for PyTorch-based geospatial workflows
- Earth Engine for large-scale data access

### Lab Session
Building an end-to-end pipeline from raw satellite data to foundation model inference

### Resources
- [TorchGeo Documentation](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/)
- [Earth Engine Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_py_01)
- Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF specification

### Next Week Preview
Week 3 will cover fine-tuning foundation models for specific applications and developing initial project proposals.
