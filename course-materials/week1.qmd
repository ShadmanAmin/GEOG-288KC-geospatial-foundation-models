## Week 1 Overview

This week introduces the fundamental concepts of geospatial foundation models (GFMs) and explores their revolutionary applications in remote sensing and environmental monitoring.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what geospatial foundation models are and how they differ from traditional ML approaches
- Explore key architectures and training approaches for GFMs
- Examine real-world applications and case studies
- Review the current landscape of available models and platforms

### Key Topics
- **Foundation Model Fundamentals**: Self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders, transformer architectures
- **Geospatial Adaptations**: Handling multi-spectral data, spatial relationships, temporal sequences
- **Available Models**: Prithvi, SatMAE, GeoFM, and other state-of-the-art models
- **Application Domains**: Land cover classification, change detection, crop monitoring, disaster response

### Activities
- [ ] Interactive demo with pre-trained geospatial foundation models
- [ ] Hands-on exploration of model architectures
- [ ] Discussion of project ideas and feasibility
