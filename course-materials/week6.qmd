## Week 6 Overview

Transition to intensive project development phase with structured planning sessions, technical guidance, and initial implementation milestones.

### Learning Objectives
- Define clear project scope, objectives, and success criteria
- Establish technical architecture and implementation roadmap
- Begin core development with proper project structure
- Set up reproducible development environments and workflows

### Project Development Framework
- **Project Definition**: Problem statement, data sources, expected outcomes
- **Technical Planning**: Architecture design, technology stack, implementation phases
- **Resource Management**: Computational requirements, data access, timeline planning
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategies, validation approaches, documentation standards

### Activities
- [ ] Finalize project proposal with detailed specifications
- [ ] Set up project repository with proper structure and documentation
- [ ] Implement core data loading and preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Establish development workflow and version control practices
- [ ] Begin initial model experiments and baseline implementations

### Individual Consultation Sessions
**Structured Guidance (9am-11am)**:
- One-on-one project planning meetings with instructor
- Technical architecture review and feedback
- Resource identification and access setup
- Timeline validation and milestone definition

**Development Time (11am-12pm)**:
- Independent implementation work
- Peer collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Technical problem-solving and debugging
- Progress documentation and repository setup

### **Major Deliverable**
**Project Proposal and Initial Implementation** (Due: End of Week 6)
- **Written Proposal** (2-3 pages): Problem statement, data sources, methodology, timeline
- **Repository Setup**: Structured codebase with documentation, environment setup
- **Initial Pipeline**: Working data loading and basic preprocessing functionality
- **Baseline Results**: Initial experiments or proof-of-concept implementation

### Technical Infrastructure
- Project repository structure and best practices
- Reproducible environment setup (conda, Docker, requirements)
- Data management and version control strategies
- Computational resource allocation and optimization

### Resources
- Project proposal templates and examples
- Repository structure guidelines
- UCSB AI Sandbox resource allocation
- Technical consultation scheduling system

### Next Week Preview
Week 7 will focus on intensive development with regular progress check-ins and technical workshops.
